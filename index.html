    <p> Hello world! </p>
    <p> Welcome to the official homepage for the HippocamPEX collaborative project. </p>
    <p> This website serves as a one stop shop for eveything related to the project. </p>
    <p> We're a bit bare-bones for now, but check back soon for updates, and some shiny CSS added </p>
    <p> Until then, check out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10586-x"> our first paper: </a>
    <p> "A scalable reinforcement learning framework inspired by hippocampal memory mechanisms for efficient contextual and sequential decision making" </p>
    <p> See you soon! </p>
